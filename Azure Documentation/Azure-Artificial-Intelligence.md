# Azure Artificial Intelligence - Product and Documentation links

## Azure Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence**, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.

Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you've purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

Some of the most common Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning service types in Azure are:

## Azure Cognitive Services

Cognitive services are a collection of domain-specific pre-trained AI models that can be customized with your data. They are categorized broadly into vision, speech, language, and search. For more information about each service, see the links in the resources section.
* **Vision**: Vision makes it possible for apps and services to accurately identify and analyze content within images and videos.
**Speech**: Vision makes it possible for apps and services to accurately identify and analyze content within images and videos.
