## VNET - Virtual Network documentation
* [VNET Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/)

Azure Virtual Network enables many types of Azure resources such as Azure VMs to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. A virtual network is scoped to a single region; however, multiple virtual networks from different regions can be connected using virtual network peering. With Azure Virtual Network you can provide isolation, segmentation, communication with on-premises and cloud resources, routing and filtering of network traffic.

## Load Balancer

* [VPN GW Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/)

A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure Virtual Network and an on-premises location over the public internet. It provides a more secure connection from on-premises to Azure over the internet.

## Azure ExpressRoute
* [Azure ExpressRoute Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/)
* [ExpressRoute documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/)

Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute enables organizations to extend their on-premises networks into the Microsoft Cloud over a private connection implemented by a connectivity provider. This arrangement means that the connectivity to the Azure datacenters doesn't go over the Internet but across a dedicated link. ExpressRoute also facilitates efficient connections with other Microsoft cloud-based services, such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365.

## Application Gateway
* [Application Gateway Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-gateway/)
* [Application Gateway documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/)

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It is the connection through which users connect to your application. With Application Gateway you can route traffic based on source IP address and port to a destination IP address and port. You also can help protect a web application with a web application firewall, redirection, session affinity to keep a user on the same server, and many more configuration options.

## Content Delivery Network
* [Content Delivery Network Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/)
* [Azure CDN Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. It is a way to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency. CDN can be hosted in Azure or any other location. You can cache content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world and provide better performance to end users. Typical usage scenarios include web applications containing multimedia content, a product launch event in a region, or any event where you expect a high bandwidth requirement in a region.
