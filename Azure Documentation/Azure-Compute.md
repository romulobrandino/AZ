# Azure Compute Services - Product and Documentation links


## Virtual Machines
* [Virtual Machines Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/)
* [Virtual Machines Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/)

Azure virtual machines let you create and use virtual machines in the cloud. It provides IaaS and can be used in a variety of different ways. When you need total control over an operating system and environment, Azure VMs are an ideal choice. Just like a physical computer, you're able to customize all the software running on the VM. This ability is helpful when you are running custom software or custom hosting configurations.

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets
* [Virtual Machine Scale Sets Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)
* [Virtual Machine Scale Sets Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)

Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs. With all VMs configured the same, virtual machine scale sets are designed to support true autoscale; no pre-provisioning of VMs is required; and as such makes it easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads. So, as demand goes up more virtual machine instances can be added, and as demand goes down virtual machines instances can be removed. The process can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.

## App service
* [App Service Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/)
* [App Service Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)

With App services , you can quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. You can meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements while using a fully managed platform to perform infrastructure maintenance. App Services is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering.

## Functions
* [Azure Functions Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
* [Azure Functions Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)

Azure Functions are ideal when you're concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. They're commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within 


## Azure Container Instances
* [Container Instances Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/)
* [Azure Container Instances Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/)

Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. It is a PaaS offering that allows you to upload your containers, which it will run for you.

## Azure Kubernetes Service
* [Azure Container Instances Product Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)
* [Azure Container Instances documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)

The task of automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers is known as orchestration. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures and large volumes of containers. Orchestration is the task of automating and managing a large number of containers and how they interact.
